LUD-22: "Send Globally" Facilitate fiat to fiat transactions over the lightning network passing across additional payout details
===============================

This LUD will facilitate fiat-to-fiat transactions over the lightning network by including optional metadata and parameters allowing users to specify payouts to supported options (such as banks or mobile money accounts). Upon an initial request to a `SERVICE` a list of supported payment options `supportedPayoutOptions` are returned and allows the `WALLET` to request the required information from the user in order to fulfill the transactions. `LUD-22` transactions will have a `sendGloballyRequest` tag instead of the traditional `payRequest` tag.

There are two potential scenarios...
- The sender sets the fiat amount and currency they want to send. 
- The sender sets the fiat amount and currency they want the recipient to receive. 

### Scenario one
Someone wants to send 10 GBP to the USA and credit the target account in USD.

- The `WALLET` makes a request, including extra information about the desired target fiat currency as a query parameter.
- The `SERVICE` then decides if it can fulfil such exchange and returns `supportedPayoutOptions`, this includes a list of supported payout options (such as banks or mobile money accounts).
- The `WALLET` displays these payout options back to the user for them to select, upon selection, user is then asked to supply data for the required fields. Once filled out and confirmed, a request is sent back to the `SERVICE` with this information.
- The `SERVICE` returns with `destExchangeData` which contains price information for the transaction and a lightning invoice to pay. This is then shown to the user along with it's own price exchange information, indicating how much USD would arrive at `SERVICE` for 10 GBP.
- Upon confirmation, `WALLET` performs the exchange from GBP, and pays the lightning invoice.


### Scenario two
Someone wants to send exactly 10 USD to the USA from their GBP enabled wallet.

- The `WALLET` makes a request, including extra information about the desired target fiat currency as a query parameter.
- The `SERVICE` then decides if it can fulfil such exchange and returns `supportedPayoutOptions`, this includes a list of supported payout options (such as banks or mobile money accounts).
- The `WALLET` displays these payout options back to the user for them to select, upon selection, user is then asked to supply data for the required fields. Once filled out and confirmed, a request is sent back to the `SERVICE` with this information.
- The `SERVICE` returns with `destExchangeData` which contains price information for the transaction and a lightning invoice to pay. This is then shown to the user along with it's own price exchange information, indicating how much GBP it would cost for the recipient to get 10 USD.
- Upon confirmation, `WALLET` performs the exchange from GBP, and pays the lightning invoice.


### Example interaction flow between a wallet and service
1. Endpoint is stored in the background and used for SendGlobally product. `WALLET` makes initial `GET` request to the endpoint which returns a list of currencies supported by the `SERVICE`.

    ```Typescript
    {
        "callback": string, // The URL from LN SERVICE which will accept the pay request parameters.
        "tag": "sendGloballyRequest", // Type of lnurl.
        "supportedCurrencies": { ["GBP", "EUR", "USD"] } // (ISO 4217)
    }
    ```

2. `WALLET` makes a `POST` request to `callback` endpoint received in the previous request with the required currency as a query parameter. \
    `?currency=GBP`
3. `WALLET` gets JSON response from `SERVICE`.

    ```Typescript
    {
        "callback": string, // The URL from LN SERVICE which will accept the pay request parameters.
        "maxSendable": number, // Max millisatoshi amount SERVICE is willing to receive.
        "minSendable": number, // Min millisatoshi amount SERVICE is willing to receive, can not be less than 1 or more than `maxSendable`.
        "metadata": string, // Metadata json which must be presented as raw string here, this is required to pass signature verification at a later step.
        "tag": "sendGloballyRequest", // Type of lnurl.
        "supportedPayoutOptions": {
            [{  "id": string, // The identifier for the payout option
                "name": string, // The name of the payout option
                "logourl": string, //  URL to an image of the payout logo for display purposes
                "requiredFields": [ // Required fields object should be returned for each payout option with the fields required to process a transaction, these can vary depending on service/payout option
                    { "name": "accountName", "datatype": "string" },
                    { "name": "accountNumber", "datatype": "string" },
                    { "name": "mobileNumber", "datatype": "string" },
                    { "name": "branchCode", "datatype": "string" }
                ]
            }]
        }
    }
    ```

    If `SERVICE` supports `LUD-22` and cannot perform the exchange, then an error must be returned.
    If `SERVICE` returns a payload without `supportedPayoutOptions`, it must be because it doesn't support `LUD-22`.

4. `WALLET` displays `supportedPayoutOptions` back to the end user allowing them to select the required one, once payout option has been chosen, user is then prompted to enter the data for the `requiredFields`.

5. Upon user confirmation, `WALLET` buys the sats and makes a `POST` request to the `callback` received in the initial request.

    Request header \
    `Authorization: Bearer <authKey>`

    Request body
    ```Typescript
        {
            "id", // The identifier for the transaction
            "amount": number, // The amount for the transaction in the unit of `currency`, can be given in BTC OR service currency in order to cover the two scenarios
            "currency": string, // The currency in which the transaction is in, `BTC` allows `WALLET` to dictate (scenario one) and any other currency allows `SERVICE` to dictate (scenario two)
            "targetCurrency": string // The currency in which the transaction should be settled in on the recipients end (this should be a currency supported by the SERVICE)
            "price": number, // The price paid to buy the Bitcoin in the source currency (will be null in scenario two).
            "webhook": string // The webhook endpoint to receive updates on destination settlement.
            "payoutOption": {
                "id", // The identifier for the payout option
                "requiredFields": [ 
                    { "name": "accountName", "value": "Satoshi Nakamoto" },
                    { "name": "accountNumber", "value": "001" },
                    { "name": "mobileNumber", "value": "123456789" },
                    { "name": "branchCode", "value": "001" }
                ]
            }
        }
    ```

    If `targetCurrency` is neither `BTC` or one the `SERVICE` supports, then an error should be returned.

6. `SERVICE` takes the POST request and returns JSON response:

    ```Typescript
        "callback": string, // Endpoint to allow WALLET to send `sourceExchangeData` to the SERVICE (depending on the scenario this may or may not be used) 
        "destExchangeData": {
            "id": string, // The transaction identifier generated by the SERVICE.
            "currency": string, // The currency (ISO 4217) passed as query, as confirmation that it is accepted.
            "price": number,  // The sell price promised for the received Bitcoin in given currency.
            "expiry": number, // The unix timestamp of when the fx rate will expire.
            "pr": string // Bolt11 invoice for the transaction.
        }
    ```

7. `WALLET` then pays the return bolt11 invoice and if suitable, send `sourceExchangeData` back to the `callback`
8. `WALLET` waits to receive webhooks to confirm final destination settlement.


### Exchange data format
Exchange data can be provided by both parties during a transaction, `destExchangeData` and `sourceExchangeData`.

```Typescript
    "destExchangeData": {
        "id": string, // The identifier for the transaction.
        "currency": string, // The currency (ISO 4217) passed as query, as confirmation that it is accepted.
        "price": number, // The sell price promised for the received Bitcoin in given currency.
        "expiry": number, // The unix timestamp of when the fx rate will expire.
        "pr": string // (Optional) Bolt11 invoice for the transaction, optional depending on whether an amount is passed across in the initial request.
    }
```

```Typescript
    "sourceExchangeData": {
        "id": string, // The identifier for the transaction
        "currency": string, // The currency (ISO 4217) the Bitcoin was bought with.
        "price": number, // The price paid to buy the Bitcoin in the source currency.
        "webhook": string // The webhook endpoint to receive updates on destination settlement.
    }
```

### Supported payout options format
```Typescript
    "supportPayoutOptions": {
        [{"id": string, // The identifier for the payout option
        "name": string, // The name of the payout option
        "logourl": string, // URL to an image of the payout logo for display purposes
        "requiredFields": [ // Required fields object should be returned for each payout option with the fields required to process a transaction, these can vary depending on service
            { "name": "accountName", "datatype": "string" },
            { "name": "accountNumber", "datatype": "string" },
            { "name": "mobileNumber", "datatype": "string" },
            { "name": "branchCode", "datatype": "string" }
        ]
        }]
    }
```

### Webhook format
Once a transaction has either settled or failed at the destination payment provider, a webhook should be sent to the `webhook`.

Request header \
`Authorization: Bearer <authKey>`

Request body
```Typescript
    {
        "id": string, // The identifier for the transaction
        "paymentStatus": string, // The status of the bolt11 invoice payment (`pending`, `success`, or `failed`)
        "payoutStatus": string, // The status of the destination settlement (`pending`, `success`, or `failed`)
        "refund": string, // (optional) The endpoint that should be used to request a refund if the settlement has failed
    }
```

### Refunds
If settlement has failed at the destination, a webhook will be received with status `failed`. Upon receipt of this webhook type, a service should `POST` to the `refund` with a valid bolt11 lightning invoice, which then should be paid by the `SERVICE`

Request header \
`Authorization: Bearer <authKey>`

Request body
```Typescript
    {
        "id": string, // The identifier for the transaction
        "pr": string, // Bolt11 invoice with the required amount to be refunded
    }
```

### Authentication Key
In order to make `LUD-22` requests to services, a wallet will require an authentication key from the `SERVICE` and include it in the requests during the flow. The authentication key should be used within the `Authorization` header of the request using the `Bearer Authentication` scheme.

Request header \
`Authorization: Bearer <authKey>`
